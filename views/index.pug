        This line is primarily for transgender people experiencing a crisis. This includes people who may
        be struggling with their gender identity and are not sure that they are transgender. While our goal
        is to prevent self harm, we welcome the call of any transgender person in need. We will do our very best
        to connect them with services that can help them meet that need. If you are not sure whether you should
        call or not, then please call us.
      p.
        Our hotline is staffed by the true experts on transgender experience, transgender people themselves.
        Our volunteers are all trans identified and educated in the range of difficulties transgender
        people experience. Our volunteers are dedicated to improving the lives of transgender people.

        Additionally, our operators will only call emergency services with your expressed consent.
